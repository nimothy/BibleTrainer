## Contributing and feature requests

There are an increasing number of requests, bug fixes and feature ideas. We're aiming to put something (small) our each month on a cycle of month one: feature, month two improvement. Please see the [project board](https://github.com/johnraftery/BibleTrainer/projects/1) for more information.

## Development

Bible Trainer is built on top of the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com).

To get startedâ€¦

At the moment, this project requires NodeJS v6, NPM v3 and Python 2.7

### VERY IMPORANT PLEASE READ ###

In order to deploy to iOS, currently you must be on NodeJS version 14, LTS is fine. 

1. Check out this repo
2. Install Ionic globally: `npm install -g ionic`
3. Install NPM packages: `npm install`
4. Run the ionic server: `npm run start`

In order to deploy to iOS, currently you must be on NodeJS version 14, LTS is fine. 

1  vim ./plugins/cordova-sqlite-storage/scripts/beforePluginInstall.js replace with var Q = require('q')
2. vim ./platforms/ios/cordova/lib/list-emulator-build-targets, fix issue with defaultTarget as shown by build //TODO: BEFORE AND AFTER NEEDED
3. vim platforms/ios/cordova/lib/build.js, fix issue with defaultValue as shown by build //TODO: BEFORE AND AFTER NEEDED
4. ionic cordova emulate ios --target="DB94866E-0E5C-44C9-A804-B8F87E5793B3" --verbose


Environment vars are stored in `src/environments`. For deployment you will need to create a file `environment.prod.ts` with relevant keys in it.

## Test builds

### Android

Make sure that you have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) installed and set up.

Then on the CLI run: `ionic cordova run android --prod`

[More details](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/)

### iOS

1. You'll need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed
2. Generate the Xcode files: `ionic cordova build ios --prod`
3. Open the .xcodeproj file in platforms/ios/ in Xcode
4. Connect your phone via USB and select it as the run target
5. Click the play button in Xcode to try to run your app

# Nim's notes that may be quite useful:

```bash
nvm use lts/fermium
git switch build24
npm i
npm run dev

vim ./plugins/cordova-sqlite-storage/scripts/beforePluginInstall.js
# Update line: 13, from `var Q = context.requireCordovaModule('q'); to `var Q = require('q');

vim ./platforms/ios/cordova/lib/list-emulator-build-targets
# Update line: 54, from `device.availability.toLowerCase().indexOf('unavailable') < 0) {` to `device.availability && device.availability.toLowerCase().indexOf('unavailable') < 0) {`

vim platforms/ios/cordova/lib/build.js
# Update line: 130, from `emulatorTarget = defaultTarget.name;' to 'emulatorTarget = 'iPhone 14';`
ionic cordova emulate ios --target="DB94866E-0E5C-44C9-A804-B8F87E5793B3" --verbose
```
